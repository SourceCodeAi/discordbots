A Showcase of most of the Active and Dormant Discord Bots I've made!

Hey! I'm a Discord Bot developer. This GitHub Repo is a showcase of most of the Discord Bots that I have made, whether dormant or Active. I want to share these bots to first off, formulate a resume and help people. Why else would I make it a public repo! You may use my code for learning purposes but if you wish to use parts of it, you must leave comments, crediting this GitHub Repo with the branch. Please do not copy the exact bots as that counts as plagiarism. I have not given this repo the MIT license!

Bot Included In its Initial Release:
  - Albedo
  - Mitsuri
  - Librarian Lisa (One of my simpler projects - extremely unfinished)
